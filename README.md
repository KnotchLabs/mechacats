# Refactoring Exercise

Welcome to Mechacats!

Your challenge is to improve the quality of our Mechacats application. We have provided you a set of passing specs and an initial implementation of Mechacats.

Please refactor Mechacats as you see fit.

The primary goal of this challenge is to see how you would refactor the application code for improved clarity and readability. Additionally, we would like you to clarify the intentions and organization of the tests. Feel free to add additional tests if you would like.

You may install any gems you might think are useful to solve the problem.

Spend no more than about 2 hours on this challenge.

# How to test

- Install Ruby (any version above 2.0)
- Install bundler using `gem install bundler`
- In your mechacats directory, use the command `bundle install`.

To run the tests:

`bundle exec rspec --format documentation mechacats_spec.rb`

# To submit your solution

Push to a public repository on github & share a link to it with Rob. Make sure to commit your work as often as you think useful.
